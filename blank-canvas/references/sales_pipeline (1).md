# 1. Why Sales Pipelines Matter
- Shows deal stages and bottlenecks  
- Creates ownership and accountability  
- Enables revenue forecasting  
- Provides buyer‑centric visibility  
- Reduces chaos, lost data, and inconsistent processes  

---

# 2. Pipeline Fundamentals
## Core Components
### **Stage**
A defined buyer‑progress milestone (e.g., Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Payment).

### **Opportunities**
Active deals in the pipeline.

### **Value**
Revenue potential if the deal closes.

### **Velocity**
How fast deals move between stages.

### **Probability**
Likelihood of winning, based on historical conversion rates.

## Key Metrics
- Average sales cycle length  
- Duration spent in each stage  
- Stage progression rate  
- Deal age  

---

# 3. Modern Pipeline Requirements
### Multi‑Product / Multi‑Segment Needs
- Separate pipelines by product line  
- Enterprise vs SMB segmentation  
- Regional views  

### Collaboration Requirements
- Multiple stakeholders per deal  
- Centralized documents & proposal mgmt  
- Integration with Slack / Teams / email  
- Real‑time activity tracking  

### AI‑Enhanced Pipeline Management
- Win probability scoring  
- Risk flags for slipping deals  
- Next‑best‑action suggestions  
- Predictive scoring

# 4. Principles of Effective Stage Design
## 1. Buyer‑Centric Progress
Stages must reflect **buyer actions**, not seller tasks.  
Examples:  
- ✔ Solution Validated  
- ✔ Business Case Reviewed  
- ✔ Final Approval Pending  
- ✘ Demo Delivered  
- ✘ Proposal Sent  
- ✘ Contract Sent  

## 2. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- A deal must belong to **one stage only**  
- Every deal must fit somewhere — no gaps  

## 3. Measurable Progression
Each stage should have:  
- Historical conversion %  
- Average time-in-stage metrics  

Example:  
“40% of deals move from Solution Validated → Business Case Reviewed.”

## 4. Observable & Verifiable
Stages must be based on **objective evidence**, not feelings.  
- ✔ Buyer shares requirements  
- ✔ Economic buyer attends demo  
- ✘ Buyer seems interested  

## 5. Actionable Next Steps
Each stage must clearly define required seller actions.  
Example (Needs Analysis):  
- Interview stakeholders  
- Document pain points  
- Map buying process

# 5. Common Stage Patterns (by Sales Motion)
## Simple B2B (4–5 Stages)
- Qualified (20%)  
- Needs Analysis (40%)  
- Proposal Review (60%)  
- Negotiation (80%)  
- Won/Lost (100%/0%)  

## Complex Enterprise (6–8 Stages)
- Qualified (10%)  
- Discovery (20%)  
- Technical Validation (20%)  
- Business Case Approved (50%)  
- Procurement Review (70%)  
- Legal Review (80%)  
- Final Approval (90%)  
- Won/Lost  

## Product‑Led Growth (PLG)
- Trial Active (20%)  
- Purchase Intent (usage threshold hit)  
- Purchase Decision (75%)  
- Won/Lost  

## SMB/Transactional
- Qualified (30%)  
- Proposal Sent (70%)  
- Won/Lost (100%)

# 6. Stage Components (What Every Stage Needs)
Each stage must specify:  
1. **Stage Name** — buyer‑centric  
2. **Entry Criteria** — requirements to enter the stage  
3. **Exit Criteria** — requirements to advance  
4. **Key Activities** — what reps must do in this stage  
5. **Success Metrics** — conversion %, avg duration, win rate  
6. **Rooting Days** — max days before flagged as stalled  
7. **Probability %** — historical close likelihood

# 7. Stage Design Mistakes (and Fixes)
| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|--------|---------|------|
| Too many stages | Confusing, admin overload | Reduce to 4–7 |
| Too few stages | No visibility | Add validation stages |
| Activity‑based stages | False progress | Use buyer outcomes |
| Inconsistent probability | Bad forecasting | Standardize by historical rates |
| No exit criteria | Optimism bias | Add objective rules |
| Linear probability (20/40/60/80) | Unrealistic | Use real conversion data |

# 8. How to Implement a Pipeline (90‑Day Rollout)
## Phase 1: Pilot (0–30 days)
- Select 2–3 teams  
- Train on criteria  

## Phase 2: Conversion Rate Analysis (30–60 days)
- Track stage‑to‑stage conversion  
- Identify bottlenecks  

## Phase 3: Probability Calibration (60–90 days)
- Compare weighted vs actual  
- Adjust probability per stage  

## Phase 4: Iteration (continuous)
- Quarterly stage & criteria refinement

# 9. Pipeline Metrics — Volume Metrics
### Total Pipeline Value
All open deals (unweighted).

### Open Opportunities Count
Indicates capacity & demand levels.

### Pipeline Adds vs Exits
Shows if pipeline is growing or shrinking.

### Pipeline by Stage
Detects stage clustering (e.g., too many early-stage deals).

### New Pipeline Created
Early indicator of future revenue.

### Benchmarks
- Enterprise AE: 15–30 opps  
- Mid‑market AE: 30–50  
- SMB AE: 50–100+  
- Pipeline target:  
  - Enterprise: 4–6× quota  
  - SMB: 2–3× quota

# 10. Pipeline Metrics — Quality Metrics
## Stage‑to‑Stage Conversion
Shows exactly where deals get stuck.

## Win Rate by Segment / Rep / Product
Reveals targeting & execution issues.

## Overall Win Rate
Strong indicator of qualification discipline.

## Loss Reason Analysis
Good:  
- “Lost to Competitor X under $50K due to price”  
Bad:  
- “Lost to competition”

### SaaS Benchmarks
- Discovery → Qualification: 60–70%  
- Qualification → Proposal: 30–40%  
- Proposal → Negotiation: 50–60%  
- Negotiation → Closed: 25–35%  

---

# 11. Forecasting Integration (Stage‑Based)
Weighted Forecast = Deal Amount × Stage Probability  

Example:  
$100,000 × 0.60 = $60,000  

Sum across all deals = Weighted Pipeline.

---

# 12. Forecast‑Optimized Stage Framework (B2B SaaS)
| Stage | Buyer Action | Exit Criteria | Probability |
|-------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Qualification | Engages with intent | BANT validated | 10% |
| Discovery | Shares pain/process | Requirements documented | 20% |
| Solution Design | Agrees solution fit | Demo + technical validation | 40% |
| Proposal | Reviews proposal | Reviewed by economic buyer | 60% |
| Negotiation | Enters pricing/legal | Terms under review | 80% |
| Verbal Commit | Verbal agreement | Paperwork in progress | 90% |
